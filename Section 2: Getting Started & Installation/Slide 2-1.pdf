Why Do They Matter?
Well...why does data matter?

Data
Is
Knowledge
Data
Is
Money
You've probably heard
of big data....
It's ok if you haven't!
Data has always played an
important role in industries
But now, data itself is a huge

booming industry!

MySQL
vs.
SQL
Let's Start With SQL
Structured
Query
Language
SQL is the language we use to

"talk" to our databases

"Find All Users"
"Find All Users Who Are 18 Years Old"
"Add A New User With Username 'JumboJim'"

Delete Every Single User!
A Quick Preview!
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age >= 18 ;

Find All Users Who Are 18 Or Older
Working With MySQL Is
Primarily Writing SQL
MySQL
SQLite
PostgreSQL
Oracle
Many Others

Relational Databases

All Use SQL

}
MySQL
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age >= 18 ;

PostgreSQL
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age >= 18 ;

There Are Slight
Differences In Syntax
Which We'll Talk About In This Course!

Two Takeaways
Once you learn SQL, it's pretty easy to
switch to another DB that uses SQL
What makes databases (DBMS) unique
are the features they offer, not the
language
Some Code
SELECT * FROM animals;

SELECT species, status FROM animals;
