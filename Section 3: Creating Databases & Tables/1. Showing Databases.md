## 🗄️ Creating and Managing Databases

## 🏗️ Database Server Architecture

### 🌐 **MySQL Database Server Structure**

Think of a MySQL server as a **building** that can house multiple **apartments** (databases):

```
🏢 MySQL Database Server
├── 🏠 Dog Walker Database
├── 🛒 Soap Shop Database  
├── 📚 Practice Database
└── 📰 News Site Database
```

Each database is a **self-contained silo** - completely separate from others! 🔒

## 🎯 Why Separate Databases?

### 🚫 **Prevent Data Contamination**

**Example Scenario:**
- 🐕 **Dog Walker App**: Users, dog profiles, walker info, payments
- 🧼 **Soap Shop**: Users, products, inventory, payments

**Problem if mixed together:**
- Dog walker users accidentally charged for soap! 😱
- Soap customers get dog walking notifications! 🤷‍♀️

**Solution with separate databases:**
- ✅ Clean data separation
- ✅ No cross-contamination
- ✅ Independent management

## 👀 Viewing Existing Databases

Before creating new databases, let's see what already exists!

### 🖥️ **Method 1: Command Line (Terminal)**

#### **Step 1: Connect to MySQL**
```bash
mysql -u root -p
```
- `-u root` = Login as root user
- `-p` = Prompt for password

#### **Step 2: View Databases**
```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

**⚠️ Important:** Don't forget the semicolon! Without it, you'll see:
```
mysql> SHOW DATABASES
    -> 
```
The `->` means MySQL is waiting for you to finish the command.

#### **Expected Output:**
```
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql             |
| performance_schema |
| sys               |
+--------------------+
```

### 🖱️ **Method 2: MySQL Workbench (GUI)**

#### **Step 1: Connect**
1. Open MySQL Workbench
2. Click your local connection
3. Enter your root password

#### **Step 2: Run Query**
```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```
Click the ⚡ **lightning bolt** to execute!

#### **Expected Output:**
Same database list, but displayed in a nice table format! 📊

When you install MySQL, you get these **system databases**:
