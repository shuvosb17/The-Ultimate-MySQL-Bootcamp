## 🎯 Challenge Instructions

**🎮 Your Mission:** Write SQL queries to generate the exact outputs shown below!

**📊 Dataset:** Our standard 7-cat table
```sql
+--------+---------------+-----------+-----+
| cat_id | name          | breed     | age |
+--------+---------------+-----------+-----+
| 1      | Ringo         | Tabby     | 4   |
| 2      | Cindy         | Maine Coon| 10  |
| 3      | Dumbledore    | Maine Coon| 11  |
| 4      | Egg           | Persian   | 4   |
| 5      | Misty         | Tabby     | 13  |
| 6      | George Michael| Ragdoll   | 9   |
| 7      | Jackson       | Sphynx    | 7   |
+--------+---------------+-----------+-----+
```

---

## 🏆 Exercise 1: Basic Column Selection

### 📋 **Target Output:**
```
+--------+
| cat_id |
+--------+
| 1      |
| 2      |
| 3      |
| 4      |
| 5      |
| 6      |
| 7      |
+--------+
```

### 🎯 **Your Task:**
Write a query that selects **only the cat_id column** for **all rows**.

### 💭 **Think About:**
- 🔍 Which column do you need?
- 📊 Do you need any filtering?
- 🎯 Are you getting ALL rows or specific ones?

---

## 🏆 Exercise 2: Multiple Column Selection

### 📋 **Target Output:**
```
+---------------+-----------+
| name          | breed     |
+---------------+-----------+
| Ringo         | Tabby     |
| Cindy         | Maine Coon|
| Dumbledore    | Maine Coon|
| Egg           | Persian   |
| Misty         | Tabby     |
| George Michael| Ragdoll   |
| Jackson       | Sphynx    |
+---------------+-----------+
```

### 🎯 **Your Task:**
Write a query that selects **name and breed columns** for **all rows**.

### 💭 **Think About:**
- 🎭 Which columns do you need?
- 📝 What's the order of columns?
- 🔗 How do you separate multiple columns?

---

## 🏆 Exercise 3: Filtered Selection (Breed-Based)

### 📋 **Target Output:**
```
+-------+-----+
| name  | age |
+-------+-----+
| Ringo | 4   |
| Misty | 13  |
+-------+-----+
```

### 🎯 **Your Task:**
Write a query that finds **all Tabby cats** and shows only their **name and age**.

### 💭 **Think About:**
- 🐱 What breed are you looking for?
- 🔍 Which column do you filter by?
- 📊 Which columns do you want to display?
- 📝 Do you need quotes for the breed name?

---

## 🏆 Exercise 4: Advanced Logic Challenge

### 📋 **Target Output:**
```
+--------+-----+
| cat_id | age |
+--------+-----+
| 4      | 4   |
+--------+-----+
```

### 🎯 **Your Task:**
Write a query that finds cats where **cat_id equals age** and shows only **cat_id and age**.

### 💭 **Think About:**
- 🧮 What mathematical relationship are you looking for?
- 🔍 How do you compare two columns?
- 📊 Looking at our data, which cats have matching ID and age?
- 🎯 This is a new concept - think about column-to-column comparison!

### 🔍 **Hint Analysis:**
```
Looking at our data:
Ringo:    cat_id=1, age=4   → 1≠4  ❌
Cindy:    cat_id=2, age=10  → 2≠10 ❌  
Dumbledore: cat_id=3, age=11 → 3≠11 ❌
Egg:      cat_id=4, age=4   → 4=4  ✅
Misty:    cat_id=5, age=13  → 5≠13 ❌
George Michael: cat_id=6, age=9 → 6≠9 ❌
Jackson:  cat_id=7, age=7   → 7=7  ✅

Wait... should there be two rows or one? Check the target output!
```

## 🧠 Skill Building Progression

### 📈 **Notice the Difficulty Progression:**

**Level 1:** Basic column selection
```sql
-- Just picking columns, no filtering
SELECT column_name FROM table;
```

**Level 2:** Multiple column selection  
```sql
-- Picking multiple columns, still no filtering
SELECT col1, col2 FROM table;
```

**Level 3:** Filtering with WHERE
```sql
-- Adding conditions to filter rows
SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition;
```

**Level 4:** Column-to-column comparison
```sql
-- Comparing columns within the same row
SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE col1 = col2;
```
