## 🏷️ Temporary Column Renaming with AS

---

## 🎯 What Are Aliases?

### 💡 **Alias Definition:**
**Alias = Temporary name for a column in query results only**

### 🔑 **Key Concepts:**
- 🏷️ **Temporary renaming** - only affects current query output
- 📊 **Display purposes** - makes results more readable
- 🛡️ **Non-destructive** - doesn't change actual table structure
- ⚡ **Uses AS keyword** - `column_name AS new_name`

---

## 🧪 Basic Alias Examples

### 📝 **Standard Query (No Alias):**
```sql
mysql> SELECT cat_id, name FROM cats;
+--------+---------------+
| cat_id | name          |
+--------+---------------+
| 1      | Ringo         |
| 2      | Cindy         |
| 3      | Dumbledore    |
| 4      | Egg           |
| 5      | Misty         |
| 6      | George Michael|
| 7      | Jackson       |
+--------+---------------+
```

### 🏷️ **With Alias - Shorter Column Name:**
```sql
mysql> SELECT cat_id AS id, name FROM cats;
+----+---------------+
| id | name          |
+----+---------------+
| 1  | Ringo         |
| 2  | Cindy         |
| 3  | Dumbledore    |
| 4  | Egg           |
| 5  | Misty         |
| 6  | George Michael|
| 7  | Jackson       |
+----+---------------+
```

**🎯 Notice:** Column header changed from `cat_id` to `id`, but data is identical!

## 🎭 Creative Alias Examples

### 🐱 **Fun Column Names:**
```sql
mysql> SELECT name AS kitty_name FROM cats;
+---------------+
| kitty_name    |
+---------------+
| Ringo         |
| Cindy         |
| Dumbledore    |
| Egg           |
| Misty         |
| George Michael|
| Jackson       |
+---------------+
```

### 📊 **Professional Aliases:**
```sql
mysql> SELECT name AS cat_name, breed AS cat_breed, age AS years_old FROM cats;
+---------------+-----------+-----------+
| cat_name      | cat_breed | years_old |
+---------------+-----------+-----------+
| Ringo         | Tabby     | 4         |
| Cindy         | Maine Coon| 10        |
| Dumbledore    | Maine Coon| 11        |
| Egg           | Persian   | 4         |
| Misty         | Tabby     | 13        |
| George Michael| Ragdoll   | 9         |
| Jackson       | Sphynx    | 7         |
+---------------+-----------+-----------+
```

## 🛡️ Table Structure Remains Unchanged

### 🔍 **Verify Original Table:**
```sql
mysql> DESC cats;
+--------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field  | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+--------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| cat_id | int          | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| name   | varchar(100) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| breed  | varchar(100) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| age    | int          | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
+--------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
```

**Original SELECT (no aliases):**
```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM cats;
+--------+---------------+-----------+-----+
| cat_id | name          | breed     | age |
+--------+---------------+-----------+-----+
| 1      | Ringo         | Tabby     | 4   |
| 2      | Cindy         | Maine Coon| 10  |
| ...    | ...           | ...       | ... |
+--------+---------------+-----------+-----+
```

**🎯 Key Point:** Aliases are **presentation-only** - they don't modify the actual table!

## 📝 Alias Syntax Variations

### ⚡ **Standard Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name AS alias_name FROM table;
```

### 🎯 **Multiple Aliases:**
```sql
SELECT 
    cat_id AS id,
    name AS cat_name,
    breed AS cat_type,
    age AS years
FROM cats;
```

### 📝 **Spaces in Alias Names:**
```sql
-- Use quotes for aliases with spaces
SELECT 
    name AS "Cat Name",
    breed AS "Breed Type",
    age AS "Age in Years"
FROM cats;
```

### ⚡ **Shorthand (AS keyword optional):**
```sql
-- These are equivalent:
SELECT name AS cat_name FROM cats;
SELECT name cat_name FROM cats;     -- AS keyword optional

-- But AS is more readable and recommended!
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### ✅ **Professional Alias Guidelines:**

**🎯 Make Names Meaningful:**
```sql
-- ✅ Good - clear and descriptive
SELECT employee_id AS emp_id, salary AS annual_salary FROM employees;

-- ❌ Poor - confusing abbreviations  
SELECT employee_id AS e, salary AS s FROM employees;
```

**📝 Use Consistent Naming:**
```sql
-- ✅ Good - consistent style
SELECT 
    first_name AS fname,
    last_name AS lname,
    email AS email_addr
FROM users;

-- ❌ Poor - inconsistent style
SELECT 
    first_name AS FirstName,
    last_name AS last_Name, 
    email AS EMAIL_ADDRESS
FROM users;
```

**📱 Consider Your Audience:**
```sql
-- For developers
SELECT user_id AS uid, created_at AS timestamp FROM users;

-- For business users
SELECT user_id AS "User ID", created_at AS "Registration Date" FROM users;
```

## 🧪 Practice Examples

### 🎯 **Try These Alias Variations:**

**Basic shortening:**
```sql
SELECT cat_id AS id, name, breed FROM cats WHERE breed = 'Tabby';
```

**Descriptive naming:**
```sql
SELECT 
    name AS pet_name,
    breed AS pet_breed, 
    age AS pet_age_years
FROM cats;
```

**Business-friendly report:**
```sql
SELECT 
    cat_id AS "Pet ID",
    name AS "Pet Name",
    breed AS "Breed",
    age AS "Age (Years)"
FROM cats
WHERE age > 8;
```

## 🤔 When NOT to Use Aliases

### ⚠️ **Avoid Overuse:**

**Simple queries don't need aliases:**
```sql
-- ✅ Fine as-is - columns are already clear
SELECT name, age FROM cats;

-- ❌ Unnecessary - doesn't add value
SELECT name AS name, age AS age FROM cats;
```

**Short table exploration:**
```sql
-- ✅ Fine for quick data checking
SELECT * FROM cats;

-- ❌ Overkill for simple exploration
SELECT 
    cat_id AS "Identifier",
    name AS "Cat Name", 
    breed AS "Breed Type",
    age AS "Current Age"
FROM cats;
```
