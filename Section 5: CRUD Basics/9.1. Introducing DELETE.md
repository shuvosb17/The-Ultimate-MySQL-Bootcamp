## üóëÔ∏è Removing Data: The Final CRUD Operation

---

## üí• DELETE: Powerful and Permanent

### üí° **DELETE Definition:**
**DELETE = Permanently remove rows from a table**

### üéØ **Key Concepts:**
- üóëÔ∏è **Removes ROWS** (not the table structure)
- ‚ö° **Permanent operation** - no undo button
- üîç **Usually needs WHERE** - to target specific rows
- üö® **Most dangerous CRUD operation** - can destroy data instantly

### üìù **D stands for:**
- **Delete** ‚úÖ (most common)
- **Destroy** ‚úÖ (same meaning)
- Both terms are used interchangeably in CRUD

---

## üîß Basic DELETE Syntax

### üìù **Essential Pattern:**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

### üéØ **Critical Components:**
1. üóëÔ∏è **DELETE FROM** - not just "DELETE" (common mistake!)
2. üìä **table_name** - which table to delete from
3. üîç **WHERE condition** - which rows to remove (usually required!)

## üö® The Ultimate Danger: DELETE Without WHERE

### üí• **Nuclear Option - Deletes EVERYTHING:**
```sql
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è CATASTROPHIC - Removes ALL rows!
DELETE FROM employees;
```

### üò± **What Just Happened:**
```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM employees;
Empty set (0.00 sec)

mysql> DESC employees;
+----------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field          | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+----------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id             | int          | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| last_name      | varchar(50)  | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| first_name     | varchar(50)  | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| middle_name    | varchar(50)  | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| age            | int          | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| current_status | varchar(50)  | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
+----------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
```

### üéØ **Key Points:**
- üíÄ **All data GONE** - 3 employees deleted instantly
- üèóÔ∏è **Table structure REMAINS** - only data removed
- üìä **DESC still works** - table exists, just empty
- üîÑ **Different from DROP TABLE** - which removes everything

## üéØ Safe, Targeted Deletion

### üê± **Example: Delete Specific Cat**

**Check what we're deleting:**
```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name = 'Egg';
+--------+------+---------+-----+
| cat_id | name | breed   | age |
+--------+------+---------+-----+
| 4      | Egg  | Persian | 4   |
+--------+------+---------+-----+
```

**Delete the specific cat:**
```sql
mysql> DELETE FROM cats WHERE name = 'Egg';
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
```

**Verify deletion:**
```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM cats;
+--------+---------------+-----------+-----+
| cat_id | name          | breed     | age |
+--------+---------------+-----------+-----+
| 1      | Ringo         | Tabby     | 4   |
| 2      | Cindy         | Maine Coon| 10  |
| 3      | Dumbledore    | Maine Coon| 11  |
| 5      | Misty         | Tabby     | 13  |
| 6      | George Michael| Ragdoll   | 9   |
| 7      | Jackson       | Sphynx    | 7   |
+--------+---------------+-----------+-----+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

**üéâ Perfect!** Egg is gone, other cats remain safe.

## üö® Common DELETE Mistake

### ‚ùå **Forgetting "FROM" - Syntax Error:**
```sql
-- ‚ùå WRONG - Missing FROM keyword
mysql> DELETE cats WHERE name = 'Egg';
ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax

-- ‚úÖ CORRECT - Includes FROM keyword  
mysql> DELETE FROM cats WHERE name = 'Egg';
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
```

### üß† **Memory Aid:**
Think of it like SELECT:
- ‚úÖ **SELECT FROM** table WHERE condition
- ‚úÖ **DELETE FROM** table WHERE condition

---

## üõ°Ô∏è The Golden Rule: SELECT Before DELETE

### üîç **Safe Deletion Workflow:**

**‚ùå Dangerous Approach:**
```sql
-- Don't do this - diving straight into deletion!
DELETE FROM customers WHERE status = 'inactive';
```

**‚úÖ Safe Approach:**
```sql
-- Step 1: Test your WHERE clause
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE status = 'inactive';

-- Step 2: Review the results
-- Are these really the customers you want to delete?
-- How many rows? Does the count make sense?

-- Step 3: If satisfied, then delete
DELETE FROM customers WHERE status = 'inactive';

-- Step 4: Verify the deletion
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers WHERE status = 'inactive';
-- Should return 0 if deletion was complete
```

## üåç Real-World DELETE Scenarios

### üßπ **Data Cleanup Operations:**

**Remove old temporary data:**
```sql
-- Delete temporary records older than 24 hours
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM temp_data WHERE created_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR);
-- Shows: 1,247 records

DELETE FROM temp_data WHERE created_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR);
-- Cleanup complete
```

**Remove test accounts:**
```sql
-- Find test users first
SELECT user_id, username, email FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%test%';

-- Delete test accounts
DELETE FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%test%';
```

**Cancel expired orders:**
```sql
-- Find expired pending orders
SELECT order_id, created_at, status FROM orders 
WHERE status = 'pending' AND created_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);

-- Remove expired orders  
DELETE FROM orders 
WHERE status = 'pending' AND created_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);
```

---

### üë§ **User Management:**

**Account deletion:**
```sql
-- User requests account deletion
SELECT user_id, username, email FROM users WHERE user_id = 12345;

-- Confirm this is the right user, then delete
DELETE FROM users WHERE user_id = 12345;
```

**Remove banned users:**
```sql
-- Find banned accounts
SELECT user_id, username, ban_reason FROM users WHERE status = 'banned';

-- Remove permanently banned accounts  
DELETE FROM users WHERE status = 'banned' AND ban_type = 'permanent';
```

---

### üì¶ **Business Operations:**

**Inventory cleanup:**
```sql
-- Remove discontinued products with no stock
SELECT product_id, name, stock_quantity FROM products 
WHERE status = 'discontinued' AND stock_quantity = 0;

DELETE FROM products 
WHERE status = 'discontinued' AND stock_quantity = 0;
```

**Order processing:**
```sql
-- Remove cancelled orders older than 1 year
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders 
WHERE status = 'cancelled' AND order_date < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR);

DELETE FROM orders 
WHERE status = 'cancelled' AND order_date < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR);
```

---

## üíÄ DELETE vs DROP vs TRUNCATE

### üéØ **Understanding the Differences:**

**DELETE - Remove Specific Rows:**
```sql
-- Removes some or all rows, keeps table structure
DELETE FROM cats WHERE age > 10;  -- Remove old cats
DELETE FROM cats;                 -- Remove all cats, keep table
```

**DROP - Remove Entire Table:**
```sql
-- Removes table structure AND all data
DROP TABLE cats;  -- Table completely gone
-- After this, even DESC cats fails!
```

**TRUNCATE - Empty Table Quickly:**
```sql
-- Removes all rows, keeps structure, faster than DELETE
TRUNCATE TABLE cats;  -- All cats gone, table remains
```

### üìä **Comparison Chart:**

| Operation | Rows | Table Structure | Rollback | Speed |
|-----------|------|-----------------|----------|-------|
| **DELETE** | ‚úÖ Selective | ‚úÖ Preserved | ‚úÖ Possible | üêå Slower |
| **DROP** | ‚ùå All Gone | ‚ùå Removed | ‚ùå Permanent | ‚ö° Fast |
| **TRUNCATE** | ‚ùå All Gone | ‚úÖ Preserved | ‚ùå Permanent | ‚ö° Very Fast |

## üß™ DELETE Examples with Our Data

### üê± **Practice DELETE Operations:**

**Delete by name:**
```sql
-- Remove Jackson
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name = 'Jackson';
DELETE FROM cats WHERE name = 'Jackson';
```

**Delete by age:**
```sql
-- Remove cats older than 12
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE age > 12;  
DELETE FROM cats WHERE age > 12;
```

**Delete by breed:**
```sql
-- Remove all Sphynx cats
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE breed = 'Sphynx';
DELETE FROM cats WHERE breed = 'Sphynx';
```

**Delete multiple conditions:**
```sql
-- Remove young Tabby cats
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE breed = 'Tabby' AND age < 10;
DELETE FROM cats WHERE breed = 'Tabby' AND age < 10;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DELETE Safety Best Practices

### üõ°Ô∏è **Professional Safety Rules:**

**1. üß™ Always Test First**
```sql
-- Test the WHERE clause
SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition;
-- Then delete
DELETE FROM table WHERE condition;
```

**2. üìä Check Row Counts**
```sql
-- See how many will be affected
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE last_login < '2023-01-01';
-- If this returns 50,000 and you expected 50... investigate!
```

**3. üíæ Backup Critical Data**
```sql
-- Create backup before major deletions
CREATE TABLE users_backup AS SELECT * FROM users;
-- Then proceed with deletions
```

**4. üéØ Use Specific Identifiers**
```sql
-- ‚úÖ Better - very specific
DELETE FROM users WHERE user_id = 123 AND email = 'user@email.com';

-- ‚ùå Riskier - might match unexpected rows  
DELETE FROM users WHERE username = 'john';
```

**5. ‚ö° Start Small**
```sql
-- Test with LIMIT first (MySQL extension)
DELETE FROM old_logs WHERE created_date < '2023-01-01' LIMIT 100;
-- Then remove LIMIT for full deletion
```

## üîÆ Advanced DELETE Patterns

### üöÄ **Coming Soon:**

**Subquery deletions:**
```sql
-- Delete based on data from other tables
DELETE FROM users 
WHERE user_id IN (
    SELECT user_id FROM login_attempts 
    WHERE failed_attempts > 10
);
```

**JOIN deletions:**
```sql
-- Delete from multiple related tables
DELETE u, p FROM users u 
JOIN profiles p ON u.user_id = p.user_id 
WHERE u.status = 'deleted';
```

**Conditional deletions:**
```sql
-- Complex business logic
DELETE FROM orders 
WHERE status = 'pending' 
AND created_date < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
AND customer_id NOT IN (SELECT user_id FROM vip_customers);
```
