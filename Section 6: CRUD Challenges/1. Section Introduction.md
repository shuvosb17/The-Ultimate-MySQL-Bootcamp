## 🎯 Skills You'll Master

### 🏗️ **Database Foundation:**
```sql
-- Create and manage databases
CREATE DATABASE shirt_shop;
USE shirt_shop;

-- Design table schemas  
CREATE TABLE shirts (
    shirt_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    article VARCHAR(100),
    color VARCHAR(100),
    shirt_size VARCHAR(10),
    last_worn DATE
);
```

### 📝 **Data Creation (CREATE):**
```sql
-- Single item insertion
INSERT INTO shirts (article, color, shirt_size) 
VALUES ('t-shirt', 'white', 'S');

-- Bulk data loading
INSERT INTO shirts (article, color, shirt_size, last_worn) VALUES
    ('t-shirt', 'white', 'S', '2023-10-15'),
    ('polo', 'blue', 'M', '2023-10-12'),
    ('hawaiian', 'floral', 'L', '2023-09-20');
```

### 👀 **Data Retrieval (READ):**
```sql
-- Basic queries
SELECT * FROM shirts;

-- Filtered searches
SELECT article, color FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size = 'M';

-- Advanced filtering
SELECT * FROM shirts WHERE color = 'blue' AND shirt_size IN ('S', 'M');
```

### ✏️ **Data Modification (UPDATE):**
```sql
-- Update single items
UPDATE shirts SET last_worn = '2023-10-20' WHERE shirt_id = 1;

-- Bulk updates
UPDATE shirts SET shirt_size = 'L' WHERE article = 'hawaiian';
```

### 🗑️ **Data Removal (DELETE):**
```sql
-- Remove specific items
DELETE FROM shirts WHERE color = 'stained';

-- Cleanup operations
DELETE FROM shirts WHERE last_worn < '2022-01-01';
```
